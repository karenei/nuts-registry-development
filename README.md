Nuts registry files for development network

Includes the events which describe the network in the /events folder.

A zip will be downloaded from https://codeload.github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-registry-development/tar.gz/master or from another url when configured.

The files contain the test organizations and real endpoints for those test organizations at different vendors

New additions can be made by submitting a PR

## Legacy registry format

The registry format change (to being event-driven) in this repository is compatible, meaning the 'flat files' below are still maintained:

- organizations.json
- endpoints.json
- endpoints_organizations.json
